<h2>openSUSE.Asia Summit 2014</h2>
<p>openSUSE is a Linux-based free operating system. It is completely dominated by the community. Whether a technology enthusiast, a developer or a business user, you can find your own version here. Besides, you will enjoy the experience of sharing with and learning from the people around the world.</p>
<p>openSUSE.Asia Summit 2014 is the first openSUSE Summit in Asia, which aims to promote openSUSE and other free and open source software in the region (especially in colleges). openSUSE.Asia Summit is a non-commercial conference. In the conference, we are going to launch a series of free and open source software lectures, discussions and workshops, so that more Asian users will have a chance to understand the concepts, use the software and join the community. Meanwhile, the summit also provides a free platform for Asian users to communicate with each other face to face. Participants can take this opportunity to learn about the related technologies and share their experiences. The first openSUSE.Asia Summit is scheduled on October 18th and 19th, 2014, in Beijing. We hope that it will be held in other countries in Asia in the next few years.</p>

<h2>openSUSE 13.1: Ready For Action!</h2>

<p>Dear contributors, friends and fans:
<a href="https://news.opensuse.org/?p=16841">The release is here</a>!
Eight months of planning, packaging, adding features, fixing issues, testing and
fixing more issues has brought you the best that Free and Open Source has to
offer, with our Green touch: Stable and Awesome.</p>

<p>
This release did benefit from the improvements to our testing infrastructure and
much attention for bug fixing. While a combination of over 6000 packages
supporting 5 architectures can never be perfect, we're proud to say this really
does represent the best Free Software has to offer! The latest desktops (five of
them!), server and cloud technologies, software development tools and everything
in between are included as well as a number of exciting, new technologies for
you to play with. Enjoy!<br/>
